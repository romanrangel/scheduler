# Work Day Scheduler

This application was worked on in colaboration with my study group.

## Header

The header displays the website name and your current days date.

This application has different textboxes for the different hours in the day (9-5).

The text boxes will be in different colors depending on your current time. Your current time text box will be displayed red, while past hours will be grey and the remaining hours will be displayed green.

When you type into the text box and click the blue save button, your input will be saved in local storage for you to retrieve when you come back to the website.
